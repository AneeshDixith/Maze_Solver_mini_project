# Labyrinth Trail

The main aim of this project was to get a deep understanding of a particular algorithm by applying it to a scenario. The algorithm of my choice is the *Dijkstra's Algorithm* which finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph.

We have modified the algorithm so that it is only used to find the shortest path between any two nodes, as originally it is used to find the shortest path between a single node and all the other nodes in the graph. This is acheived by stopping the algorithm once the shortest path for the desired node is found.

##  What is the Labyrinth?

Labyrinth is nothing but a maze where a square can either be a wall or a room. The goal is to enter the maze and navigate to the end in the shortest way (in case multiple way's are present) or just reach the end.

Our objective was to apply "Dijkstra's Algorithm" to solve this maze.
